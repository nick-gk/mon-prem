Small Redux based Angular 8 application for creating, saving and printing orders for funeral monuments products that I have created in my free time. <br><br>
The idea came after aknowledging the struggle one of my relatives that runs a business in the funeral market has with logging and accessing order details and history. <br><br>
I have uploaded the app as a static website on firebase: https://mon-prem.web.app/ <br>
